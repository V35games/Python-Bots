This reddit bot is made for the subreddit r/pythonforengineers, however it can
be modified to support any subreddit at your own caution. In order to run it, you
must modify the praw.ini file with your reddit developer client_id, client_secret, etc.
Please make sure to have the proper files already installed as well. 
For more information, please visit 
http://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/. This bot is built using base code 
from this website, however both files (bot.py, and main.py) are written by me, Vishay Singh.
